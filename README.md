# SinglePlayerMap
This is where I'll back up and record the development process of my single player level map for Quake.
* Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/CiarennHollis/SinglePlayerMap/wiki) for more information.


# Notepad
* Maybe allow the player to be able to get up on top of the walls of the labyrinth -> maybe there's a secret up they can get to up there [NOPE - makes just walking ontop of the labyrinth walls and then jumping down behind the locked doors possible.]
* Put grunts or something in towers in the tribute room and make those areas secret areas that can be accessed via a button in the rest room behind the tribute room. [ADDED and MODIFIED - added balconies to the tribute room that the player can get up onto from other room, idk if I want to put grunts on those or not yet]
