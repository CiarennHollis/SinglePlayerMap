# SinglePlayerMap
This is where I'll back up and record the development process of my single player level map for Quake.
* Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/CiarennHollis/SinglePlayerMap/wiki) for more information.


# Notepad
* Maybe allow the player to be able to get up on top of the walls of the labyrinth -> maybe there's a secret up they can get to up there
